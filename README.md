# hello-world
## this is my first repository lol

Hello! 
My name is **Reshma** and I'm getting started on GitHub *for the fun of it*.
I finished my **Masters** in January and I was working on a *project* that I >finished ğŸ™„ last week.
I plan to save the codes I used then here and hopefully? Make more ğŸ¦¾. 
Let's see how this goes aight! ğŸ˜¹
